        About Steve
      </h4>
        <p>
          Steven Harrington is a wonderful father, avid outdoorsman and works hard to make Michigan a better place. Steve Harrington hails from Flint Michigan where he grew up until he was eighteen years old. When Steve was a young boy, he became a boy scout and loved everything about the outdoors, conservation and the resposibilty that the title of being a scout demands. He earned  Eagle Scout at the age of 14. This is where his love for the outdoors began. Steve then moved to East Lansing to attend Michigan State University earning a bachelor’s degree in geology.

          Steve began his career in the mid eighties working as an intern for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the Groundwater Control Division in Lansing Michigan. His love for the outdoors and environment drove his passion to do everything he could do to protect and restore Michigan’s natural wilderness. His early work performance was impressive and his desire to be directly involved in the front lines of pollution clean up efforts earned him a position in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, known as the UP, for environmental remediation programs.

          For the last thirty years he has investigated, planned and managed over three dozen major industrial and chemical cleanup projects costing millions of dollars to restore the UP’s precious natural forest lands and lake shores. He is now a Senior Environmental Quality Analyst, leading major cleanup operations from past industries that severely polluted the environment from the last 100 years.

          Steve is a father to four amazing children, Lindsay, Kevin, Dylan and Kayla. Steve’s children have all gone on to college and started their own careers and families. His two oldest, now have children of their own. Steve eagerly spoils his grandkids as much as possible. His kids regularly get together for almost every holiday throughout the year and he is always involved spending time with his family. <br><br>

          Steve’s love for the outdoors is not just about his work life. He loves to spend his free time camping and hiking Michigan’s many state parks and forest lands. He spent his college years enjoying the outdoors and this passion drove his desire to have a career in protecting and restoring the environment. When his kids were young, he took them to every waterfall hike in the UP. There is this old UP waterfall hiking guidebook that Steve bought many years ago and he documented date and who attended for each of these hikes. This book has been handed down to his kids and passed around over the years as they also visited these awesome waterfalls.

          In the last several years, as his kids have all moved on, Steve has spends his free time planning hiking trips to the country’s many epic national parks. In July of 2021 alone he visited five national parks while also attending a wedding, spending time with his brother and sister, and three of his kids. He's been busy. Steve is planning and hoping to get the opportunity to visit Crater Lake and Yosemite National Parks in the near future.
